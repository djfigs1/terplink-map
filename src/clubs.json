We are a nationally ranked Model UN travel team, and host our own high school conference 'UMUNC'.", "description": "<p><strong><u>MEETINGS TUESDAY 5-6PM!</u></strong></p>\r\n<p><em>Founded</em> in 2013 as UMD Model United Nations, Maryland MUN is a social-professional student organization focused on developing members' skills in public speaking, debate, leadership, networking, collaboration, and program management, as well as engaging with the world of international relations, public policy, and diplomacy.</p>\r\n<p><em>Before&nbsp;</em>2017, UMD Model UN had sat idle for several years. In 2017, it was re-founded, but languished under poor leadership. In 2018, the organization was taken over by Sehej Singh, who, with the help of several high-profile student leaders, enacted an aggressive growth and rebranding campaign that saw the organization grow from less than 30 members to over 250 and become a top-50 nationally ranked team in less than 2 years.</p>\r\n<p><em>Following</em> the explosive growth of the organization, UMD MUN was poised to expand its mission beyond just that of the college Model UN circuit. In 2019, the organization ran its inaugural high school Model UN conference, UMUNC I, drawing over 150 delegates from across the country. By adding UMUNC, UMD MUN established itself as one of the premiere Model United Nations organizations in the country. The annual UMUNC conference continues to develop the next generation of diplomats and recruit high-performing high schoolers to the university.</p>\r\n<p><em>After </em>introducing UMUNC, UMDMUN became a powerhouse on campus and needed a restructure. The organization was now more than just a Model UN travel team, with plans to branch out further. In early 2020, UMD Model United Nations was rebranded into the Maryland International Relations Association, encompassing the UMD Model UN travel team, the UMUNC high school conference, and a brand-new section of the organization, the MIRA Institute, the professional development arm of MIRA</p>\r\n<p><em>Through</em> structured debate and critical thinking in general body meetings, students develop skills in public speaking, technical writing and research that will help them become future leaders in a variety of industries.</p>\r\n<p>Maryland MUN is proud to be represented by a diverse group of students across campus. Despite being so topical within international relations, Maryland MUN has one of the widest ranges of majors, ages, cultures, and personal backgrounds on campus. Each member contributes something unique that has helped Maryland MUN become what it is today.</p>", "status": "Active", "categories": ["Media/Publications", "Political", "Professional", "SGA Recognized", "SGR Money", "KFS Accounts"], "icon": "https://se-images.campuslabs.com/clink/images/3a1ca337-abc9-4936-84d1-7bcd32eac55bda9bd4f5-00fc-4790-8b7e-8881c8ead9bc.png", "totalMembers": 225}, {"id": "278482", "key": "terpmusic", "shortName": "MMBS", "name": "Maryland Music Business Society", "summary": "The Maryland Music Business Society aims to be the leading platform for aspiring music professionals, welcoming students from all majors and years to pursue their passion for music regardless of their degree.

We bring together the best and brightest leaders on campus.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Omicron Delta Kappa National Leadership Honor Society was founded December 3, 1914, at Washington and Lee University, by fifteen students and faculty leaders. They felt that there was a need to recognize leadership and bring together faculty and students from the various phases of college life in the tradition of the idealism of George Washington and Robert E. Lee. They believed that through the sharing of opportunities and experience both the members of the society and the institution would benefit.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>There were three principal founders of Omicron Delta Kappa: J. Carl Fisher, who was Business Manager of the Student Magazine; Rupert Nelson Latture, President of the YMCA; and, William Mosely Brown, Phi Beta Kappa. Together with three faculty members, including the President of the University and the Dean of Engineering, these men gradually selected nine additional men to affiliate with them. When there were fifteen members, the first public announcement of the establishment of Omicron Delta Kappa was made in the student newspaper on January 12, 1915. With the passage of Title IX of the Civil Rights Act, the first woman was elected to ODK in 1973. Prior to that, women were selected for Mortar Board and men for ODK.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The Sigma Circle of ODK was founded on February 2, 1927 by six men who immediately began tapping undergraduate members of ODK. Formerly, men knew that they were being considered for ODK if they were invited to the Calvert Cotillion in December. Their formal initiation would occur at a convocation in the Spring. Many famous people have been initiated into Sigma Circle, some as student and faculty members, others as Honorary members. Some of Sigma Circle&rsquo;s famous members include President Franklin D. Roosevelt, Vice President Alben W. Barkley, the Earl of Halifax, Admiral Stansfield Turner, and Congressman Steny Hoyer.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Sigma Circle is very proud of its long and proud history. It originated the Annual Awards Banquet; awards an annual $1,000 scholarship to an incoming freshman who was a high school leader; selects the &ldquo;Top Ten Freshmen&rdquo; and the &ldquo;Sophomore Leader of the Year;&rdquo; and with the help of alumni donations constructed the ODK Fountain on McKeldin Mall, which was built to create a lasting monument to leadership and to those who have contributed so much to the campus. All of the names of those people involved with ODK since 1927 are engraved on the granite sides of the ODK Fountain, which was dedicated in April 1997.</p>", "status": "Active", "categories": ["Honorary/Honor Society"], "icon": "https://se-images.campuslabs.com/clink/images/8cfe7b74-0586-46b5-9e4b-39b0aacbf35670f4deb2-148d-4f51-8bb9-a77db3a7356f.jpg", "totalMembers": 28}, {"id": "279765", "key": "one-for-the-world", "shortName": "OFTW", "name": "One for the World", "summary": "One for the World is a student organization that encourages undergraduates and graduates to give a percentage of their future annual income to one of our many charities.
